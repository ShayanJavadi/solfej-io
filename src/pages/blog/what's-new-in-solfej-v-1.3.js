            <h2>Interactive Lesson Examples</h2>
            <p>Interactive music theory lessons was one of the most requested features. I've added audible examples to almost every music theory lesson.</p>
            <p>On top of that I've also added an interactive piano roll to some of the lessons. This is to help visualize the concepts.</p>

            <h2>Revised Lessons</h2>
            <p>As most of you noticed the lesson plan (specially the music theory) was at a primal stage. The new update aims to fix that.</p>
            <p>I've fixed spelling and grammar issues for each lesson. Some of the lessons included inaccuracies. Those are fixed as well.</p>
            <p>I've also moved around some of the lessons. This is to ensure that the lesson paths makes sense, and concepts are introduced in the right order.</p>
            <p>P.S. feel free to drop me a line if you see any issues with the text!</p>
            <h2>New Lessons</h2>
            <p>There's 3 brand new music theory lessons!</p>
